DYimageFX-<version>.jar file


How to use the jar file in your project?
-----------------------------------------
1. Download the DYimageFX-<version>.jar file.
2. Add the jar file in the class path of your IDE [NetBeans, JCreator etc]
3. Write import dyimagefx.*; to import the classes and packages.


For instance, if you want to import the dyimagefx classes inside your Test.java file, then write the following line

import dyimagefx.*;

inside your Test.java file.

So your Test.java file may look something like this

    import java.io.*;

    import dyimagefx.*;

    public class Test{

        //your code goes here...

    }//class Test ends here
